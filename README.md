v2 of the website is deployed, to view the live website visit https://aniketgs.netlify.app

The technologies used in the website are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, React.js & Redux.

The website consists of 4 pages i.e.
* Home page with all the general detail about the shop and catalog of games we can buy. We can add items to cart and view thier details from here.
* Details page consists of more details of the specific game we selected.
* Contact page consists of details like address, contact information, etc. There is also a form to directly contact the shop for queries.
* Cart page consists of all the items added to cart with their total price. We can proceed to buy or empty the cart from here.

The website, being a game shop was made in order to attract attention of potential buyers i.e. Gamers who land on the website. The first thing we see on the website is a carousel of all the games availale in the shop. The carousel changes images in quick intervals in order to attract attention and also show more games to the buyers.
Home page was decorated with blue glow from the edges of images which mimic RGB lights that gamers use with their gaming setup.

Bootstrap was used for making the website responsive as it takes away a large chunk of work needed for the task.

To avoid repeating code I did the following:
1.Reusing components like navigation bar .
2.Creating an array of all the data(game data), then mapped it on the components instead of creating the same component with diffrent data multiple times.
3.React was used to make the website more snappier and feel more appealing.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
